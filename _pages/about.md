I am an assistant professor in the [School of Integrated Circuits](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University associated with the [Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications (CECA)](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/). 
Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin from 2018 to 2019. 
I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2018 
and the B.S. degree in Microelectronics from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2013.
My research interests include VLSI CAD, machine learning applications, heterogeneous computing. 
I am a recipient of 
the Best Paper Awards at DATE 2023, DATE 2022, TCAD 2021, DAC 2019, Integration, the VLSI Journal 2018, and SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference 2016. 

I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with background in computer science, microelectronics, electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, or related areas, working on research fields of 

1. machine learning assisted CAD; 

2. GPU/FPGA acceleration. 

**Opening positions available**: Ph.D., Post Doc, Engineer, Interns.
