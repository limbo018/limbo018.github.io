We present **[OpenMPL](https://github.com/limbo018/OpenMPL)**, an open-source multiple patterning layout decomposition framework for advanced multiple patterning lithography. 
Current features include:
- Contact or metal layer decomposition 
- Stitching 
- Support 3 or 4 coloring 
- Density control 
- Multi-threading 
- Small memory usage 
- Multiple algorithms: ILP (Gurobi or Lemon CBC), SDP (Csdp API), LP (Gurobi API), Dancing Links
